							<!-- <h1>Hi, my name is Andrew. </h1> -->
							<h1><span id="typing-text"></span></h1>
							<p class="major">I recently graduated from <a href="https://www.fit.edu">Florida Tech</a> with a Bachelor's in Astronomy & Astrophysics along with a Minor in Computer Sciences. I'm a French/American dual citizen with experience in both countries and a love for travelling. Iâ€™m passionate about esports and strategy games, in particular, <a href="https://www.moxfield.com/users/AndrewBurger"> Magic: The Gathering</a> and <a href="https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/Burger%23Nubs/overview"> Valorant</a>. </p>

							<h2>Astrophysics</h2>
							<p>My first research experience involved converting 2D images of relativistic black hole jets into 3D images, and during this time I began learning the fundamentals of scientific programming and image processing with Python. After this, I moved on to a more personalized project in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-astrophysics/">Flatiron CCA</a> and members of <a href=" https://www.upenn.edu">UPenn</a>. This project revolves around <a href="https://aasnova.org/2019/11/13/hunting-for-a-dark-matter-wake/">satellite-induced dark matter wakes</a> which we explore via simulations and synthetic surveys. I am still working on that project to this day, with a paper on its way soon. </p>

							<h2>Computer Science</h2>
							<p>My first experience with computer science happened in high school robotics. I'd love to be poetic about how this experience changed me as a person, but to be quite frank, I hated it. I didn't touch coding again until college, where I took an introductory C++ class and thought to myself, "Hey, this is pretty fun!". Big mistake. I've been falling down the programmer rabit hole ever since. </p>

							<h2>Esports</h2>
							<p> Most people have sports they like to watch, like football (the fake american one) or football (the real one). But as a nerdy kid, I've always had esports. In my teens I kept up with various video game championships, and in college I fell in love with Valorant and have been following the competitive scene ever since. When Florida Tech's Esports Center was first established, I had the joy of working as the president of the esports club as we helped put esports on the map. Nowdays, you can find me shoutcasting our schools Valorant games on the Florida Tech Esports twitch page, where I get to ramble on about my knowledge of strategies while having a blast at the same time. </p>

							<h2>Skillset</h2>
							<p>Below is a list of some of my skills I've accumulated throughout my academic career. </p>
							<div class="items style1 medium onscroll-fade-in">
								<section>
									<!-- <span class="icon solid style2 major fa-python"></span> -->
									<span class="icon brands style2 major fa-python"></span>
									<h3>Python</h3>
									<p>In astrophysics, Python reigns supreme. This is the language I am most comfortable and experienced in, having used it for both school and reserach. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<!-- <span class="icon solid style2 major fa-java"></span> -->
									<span class="icon brands style2 major fa-java"></span>
									<h3>Java</h3>
									<p>This is the primary language I used while completing my computer science courses. It's through Java that I learned more rigourous coding concepts, such as recursion and object-oriented programming. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-plus"></span>
									<h3>C++</h3>
									<p>This is the first ever coding language I learned in college, which gave me my first understanding of basic coding concepts such as arithmetic, syntax, and looping. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-layer-group"></span>
									<h3>Numpy</h3>
									<p>I use the <a href="https://numpy.org">Numpy</a> library everyday when I'm coding in python, as it makes life easy when it comes to multi-dimensional arrays and high-level math functions. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-chart-line"></span>
									<h3>Matplotlib</h3>
									<p>Similarily to Numpy, this is one of the python libraries I am the most used to using on the daily. <a href="https://matplotlib.org">Matplotlib</a> allows me to make complex and even dynamic graphs for my work. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-meteor"></span>
									<h3>Astropy</h3>
									<p><a href="https://www.astropy.org">Astropy</a> is the go-to library when it comes to astronomy, making astronomical calculations and data visualization easy to use. It allows astronomers like myself to analyze vast datasets and perform complex calculations on a large scale. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-table"></span>
									<h3>Pandas</h3>
									<p>As I've plunged into large scale data, in both astronomy and computer science, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org">Pandas</a> has been an invaluable tool. Through Pandas I am able to clean, filter, and transform large datasets with ease. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-star"></span>
									<h3>Apache Spark</h3>
									<p>If Pandas doesn't work, <a href="https://spark.apache.org">Apache Spark</a> is my second line of defense when I have to pull out the big guns. It is designed to distribute data across clusters of machines and can store much larger datasets in a more efficient way. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<!-- <span class="icon solid style2 major fa-kickstarter"></span> -->
									<span class="icon brands style2 major fa-kickstarter"></span>
									<h3>Keras</h3>
									<p>AI has always been a facinating topic for me, and I've enjoyed learning about it in an academic setting. My primary tool for building neural networks is <a href="https://keras.io">Keras</a>, which provides an easy interface to the complex and powerful <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org">Tensorflow</a> library. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-cloud"></span>
									<h3>JupyterHub</h3>
									<p>Cloud computing is a necessity when it comes to astrophysics coding with data of astronomical size (see what I did there?). <a href="https://jupyter.org/hub">JupyterHub</a> has given me a stepping stone into the world of cloud computing from the comfort of my Jupyter notebooks.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<!-- <span class="icon solid style2 major fa-markdown"></span> -->
									<span class="icon brands style2 major fa-markdown"></span>
									<h3>Markdown</h3>
									<p>Pretty code is good code! As a scientist it's my job to make sure everyone can understand my work (no more spaghetti code for you). That's why I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> when I'm working in Jupyter Notebooks. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid style2 major fa-leaf"></span>
									<h3>LaTeX</h3>
									<p>Ever wondered how scientist make fancy equations and prestine papers? Look no further than LaTeX, the scientific standard for formating text. <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/home-2">Overleaf</a> is my personal go-to LaTeX editor when it comes to beautifying papers. </p>
